# Smart To-Do List Application

This project is a task management application designed to help users efficiently organize, track, and manage daily activities. The system allows users to add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate structured application development, data handling, and user interaction logic implementation.

---

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Display pending and completed tasks
- Persistent task storage (if file/database used)
- Simple and intuitive interface

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- File Handling / JSON (if used)
- Tkinter / CLI (depending on implementation)
- Basic Data Structures

---

## Methodology

### 1. Task Storage
